You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

1) I did the coding bootcamp, Coding Dojo, last year so this is not new to me. I am hoping to fill out some holes in my front-end skillset. I haven't learned anything new yet. 

2) HTML mockup is very easy :)

3) Nothing is difficult yet. 

4) I have used tons of Googling and using w3c school for my problem solving.
